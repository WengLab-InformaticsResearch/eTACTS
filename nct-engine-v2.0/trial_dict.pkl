Chronic medical\n             diagnoses/conditions should be stable for the last 60 days (no hospitalizations,\n             emergency room (ER), or urgent care for condition or need for supplemental oxygen).\n             This includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a\n             result of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis/condition in the 60 days\n             before enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of health care\n             provider, insurance company, etc., or done for financial reasons, and in the same\n             class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.\n             Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as\n             determined by the participating site principal investigator (PI) or appropriate\n             sub-investigator, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.\n             Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the\n             participating site PI or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to\n             subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity, and do not indicate\n             a worsening of medical diagnosis/condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent\n             to enrollment and study vaccination are acceptable provided the change was not\n             precipitated by deterioration in the chronic medical condition, and there is no\n             anticipated additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of\n             responses to study vaccination.\n\n         11.

S'-  INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the\n        following criteria:\n\n        Subjects within 1-28 days of documented COVID-19 infection for acute care:\n\n          -  Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the\n             duration of the study\n\n          -  Male or female, aged 18 to 80 years\n\n               -  Only a minority of children and adolescents have been described as developing\n                  serious illness with COVID-19 infection. As such, this is not an age group at\n                  significant risk from complications due to this infection. Adults older than 80\n                  years of age represent a group with the greatest risk of mortality from COVID-19\n                  infection. The presence of significant co-morbidities requiring care that cannot\n                  be\n\n        provided at the CC would present a disadvantage to them to have their acute care provided\n        for in the CC.\n\n          -  Documentation of positive SARSCoV-19 test by nucleic acid detection (COVID-19\n             infection , RT-PCR)\n\n          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed\n             consent document.\n\n        Subjects during recovery phase of the acute illness (day 28 and beyond) if care has been\n        received at a facility outside of NIH:\n\n          -  Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the\n             duration of the study\n\n          -  Male or female, aged 18 to 80 years\n\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n        An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation\n        in this study:\n\n          -  Pregnancy or lactation\n\n          -  Serious mental illness (e.g. schizophrenia, manic depression) that would limit the\n             ability of the participant to participate willingly into the study.\n\n             --The conduct of the study requires participation in studies that may be unduly\n             stressful (e.g. MRI, bronchoscopy).\n\n          -  Severe claustrophobia that would prohibit the conduct of imaging by MRI even if\n             sedation is provided.\n\n          -  Patients requiring mechanical ventilation at an outside hospital prior to transfer.\n             Transporting these patients adds risk to their care.'

Evidence of irreversible injury deemed non-survivable even if the pulmonary failure\n             recovers (for example severe anoxic brain injury)\n\n          2. Known active inflammatory bowel disease\n\n          3. Known active, untreated diverticulitis\n\n          4. Known untreated bacteremia\n\n          5. Pregnancy. (The protocol will exclude pregnant subjects given the lack of overall data\n             on use of clazakizumab in pregnancy however the study team would consider a protocol\n             revision should more than 3 potential pregnant study subjects be excluded on this\n             basis).\n\n          6.

Gout/history of gout or hyperuricemia (above the ULN);\n\n          5. Oxygen saturation (SPO2)\xe2\x89\xa493% or arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2)/ fraction of\n             inspired O2 (FiO2)\xe2\x89\xa4300 mmHg;\n\n          6. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to Favipiravir;\n\n          7. Known severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CcCl) <30 mL/min] or having\n             received continuous renal replacement therapy, hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis;\n             CcCl is to be calculated by the following Cockcroft-Gault formula only when the serum\n             creatinine is\xef\xbc\x9e1.5\xc3\x97ULN\n\n          8. Possibility of the subject being transferred to a non-study hospital within 72h;\n\n          9. Pregnant or lactating women;\n\n         10. Having used Favipiravir or participated in any other interventional drug clinical\n             study within 30 days prior to first dose of study drug.\n\n        Note: Considering that COVID-19 requires immediate treatment, absence of severe\n        hepatic/renal disorders (e.g., cirrhosis, long-term dialysis) in the medical record can be\n        used as an evidence for eligibility determination. It is recommended that hepatic function\n        and creatinine be examined whenever possible.'

S"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients treated in ICCU or ICU (polyvalent, surgical or medical), in one of the\n             participating hospitals, for symptoms of acute myocarditis confirmed by a myocardial\n             MRI and/or a CT scan and/or a myocardial biopsy. It seems important to include elderly\n             patients who may be under guardianship or curatorship since these patients seem to\n             present the most severe forms. Additionally, the populations most affected by viral\n             myocarditis are generally adolescents and young adults,which justifies including them\n             in the study too. Pregnant women are a population at potentially greater risk,\n             particularly during the third trimester because of the neuro-hormonal changes inherent\n             in pregnancy. This justifies trying to implement the investigator's knowledge through\n             this observational study.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Refusal to participate."

S'Inclusion criteria include:\n\n          1. parents willing to participate in the ASSIST 12-week intervention, who have an\n             offspring with ASD between the ages of 16 and 26 years. This age range was chosen to\n             allow for the testing of whether the ASSIST is more effective if offered prior to\n             versus after high school exit (a key moderator in Aim 4). The investigators set a\n             lower bound of age 16, as that is when transition planning is mandated to have begun\n             in the schools, and an upper bound of age 26 to capture families of youth who are\n             still in the "transition years" as defined by the Institute of Medicine. If both\n             parents in a family want to attend the training, the investigators will allow it but\n             will designate one as the study\'s primary respondent;\n\n          2. parents are willing to be randomized to the treatment or control condition;\n\n          3. parents are able to travel weekly to one of the project sites (Nashville, TN;\n             Chicagoland;IL; Madison/Milwaukee, WI) to participate in the group ASSIST sessions (12\n             weekly sessions). The responding parent and the offspring with ASD must also be able\n             to travel to a project site for a diagnostic evaluation to confirm the ASD diagnosis\n             (using the gold- standard Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 or ADOS-2) and to\n             establish IQ and adaptive behavior functioning;\n\n          4. the participating parent and youth must live in one of the states where the\n             intervention is being delivered, as the adult service system is different in every\n             state;\n\n          5. son/daughter has a previous diagnosis of ASD from an educational or health care\n             provider, and meets lifetime cut-offs for ASD in a telephone screening of the Social\n             Communication Questionnaire. This will decrease the risk that youth fail to meet\n             diagnostic criteria for ASD during the diagnostic evaluation. Note that although the\n             investigators will collect IQ and adaptive behavior information to assess functioning\n             of the offspring with ASD, this information will not be used to determine eligibility;\n             parents of offspring with all levels of functioning can participate in the ASSIST\n             project; and\n\n          6. the participating parent is proficient with the English language, as all ASSIST\n             presentations and data collection materials are in English.\n\n        Exclusion criteria include:\n\n          1. parents unable to participate in the ASSIST 12-week intervention due to scheduling\n             conflicts, or who are unable to travel weekly to one of the sites;\n\n          2. parents NOT willing to be randomized to the treatment or control condition;\n\n          3. parents and/or youth do NOT live in one of the states where the intervention is being\n             delivered;\n\n          4. The youth does not have a previous diagnosis of ASD from an educational or health care\n             provider\n\n          5. The youth does not meet lifetime cut-offs for ASD in a telephone screening of the\n             Social Communication Questionnaire, answered by the parent.\n\n          6. The participating parent is not proficient with the English language.'

All\n        participants are currently living in Norway and thus experiencing identical NPIs, and who\n        had provided digital consent to partake in the study.\n\n        How the participants were reached:\n\n        Given the time-sensitivity of the project and the strict and time-consuming process of\n        getting approval to access registry data, the investigators did not apply for access to\n        registry data (e.g., address, phone or e-mails of the general population), as such data\n        access is highly strict and regulated in Norway and the time-frame of such an application\n        could have encompassed variation in an important variable we wished to hold constant\n        (namely identical NPIs (non-pharmacological interventions) employed over the time-frame of\n        data collection). Thus, the investigators did not apply for registry data, reached out the\n        population through the means elaborated below. The investigators reached out to the general\n        Norwegian population systematically in the following six ways, with the goal of providing\n        the entire adult population an equal opportunity to be exposed to the survey:\n\n          1. Through broadcasting on the main national news channel of Norway which had nearly 1.1\n             million viewers at the time of broadcast.\n\n          2. Using Facebook Business Advertisement where we exposed all adult Norwegian Facebook\n             users (3.6 million; 85% of the Norwegian adult population) with an equal opportunity\n             of being exposed to the survey in a random manner. Our survey reached a random\n             selection of nearly 180 000 of the adult population.\n\n          3. Broadcasting the survey on national and region radio stations across the country\n\n          4. Broadcasting about the survey on local radio stations across the country\n\n          5. Using national newspaper to reach out to participants about the survey\n\n          6. Using regional and local newspapers to reach out to participants across all regions\n             and counties in Norway.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        - None'

S'Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Adult (>18 years) within 24 hours of admission to intensive care unit with proven or\n             suspected COVID-19 infection. For the purpose of this study, intensive care unit is\n             defined as a facility that allow continuous monitoring of vital functions and oxygen\n             administration .

Female subjects and male partners of female\n        subjects must continue to use highly effective contraception for 30 days after the last\n        dose of study drug. Female subjects should not donate oocytes during this time. Male\n        subjects and female partners of male subjects must continue to use highly effective\n        contraception for 90 days. Male subjects must agree not to donate sperm during this time.\n\n        Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception\n        for the subject.\n\n        Note: Ethinyl estradiol is the primary estrogen used in hormonal contraceptives. The\n        progestin component consists of norethindrone, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norethindrone\n        acetate, ethynodiol diacetate, norgestimate, desogestrel, and drospirenone. As BLD-2660 is\n        a weak CYP3A4 inducer, exposure to both the estrogen and progestin components in hormonal\n        contraceptives may be decreased, resulting in an increased risk of pregnancy. As such, it\n        is recommended that subjects who are on hormonal contraceptives for birth control should\n        use an alternate means of contraception (condoms, diaphragms, intrauterine device (IUD),\n        other barrier methods, sexual abstinence, etc.) during participation in the study.\n\n        Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening\n        within 72 hours prior to first administration of study drug.\n\n        Women not of childbearing potential must be postmenopausal (defined as cessation of regular\n        menstrual periods for at least 1 year\n\n        Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements\n        and restrictions listed in the ICF and in this protocol\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        Active bacterial pneumonia infection\n\n        Known active tuberculosis (TB).\n\n        History of Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis.\n\n        History of ischemic heart disease or myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome.\n\n        Subjects requiring supplemental oxygen \xe2\x89\xa50.75 FiO2.\n\n        It is not in the best interest of the subjects to participate, in the opinion of the\n        treating Investigator.\n\n        Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive within the\n        projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 90 days after\n        the last dose of study drug.\n\n        The following laboratory parameters are excluded:\n\n          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >5 x upper limit of\n             normal (ULN);\n\n          -  Creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min.\n\n        Requiring, or expected to require mechanical ventilation at screening.\n\n        Treatment with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine at study entry.\n\n        Treatment with anti-IL 6, anti-IL-6 receptor antagonists, or with Janus kinase inhibitors\n        (JAKi) in the past 30 days or plans to receive during the study period.\n\n        Participation in any other clinical study of an experimental drug treatment for COVID-19\n        within 6 half-lives of the experimental treatment.\n\n        Note: Subjects participating in an observational study are an exception to this criterion\n        and may qualify for the study with Sponsor approval.\n\n        Note: Subjects who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may\n        participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous\n        investigational agent.\n\n          -  Unable to swallow solid oral medication or known malabsorption disorder.\n\n          -  Subjects who have allergy to BLD-2660 or inactive components of BLD-2660.'

S'Inclusion Criteria:\n\n        - All health-care or public service provides above 18 was eligible for inclusion in this\n        study. Vulnerable health-care or public service providers was in this sample defined as\n        doctors, nurses, psychologists, and any other health-care workers, as well as politicians\n        and social workers. The participants reported if they worked directly or indirectly with\n        COVID-19 patients.\n\n        Given the time-sensitivity of the project and the strict and time-consuming process of\n        getting approval to access registry data, the investigators did not apply for access to\n        registry data (e.g., address, phone or e-mails of the general population), as such data\n        access is highly strict and regulated in Norway and the time-frame of such an application\n        could have encompassed variation in an important variable the investigators wished to hold\n        constant (namely identifical NPIs (non-pharmacological interventions) employed over the\n        time-frame of data collection). Thus, the investigators did not apply for registry data,\n        but still attempted to obtain a probability sample through the means elaborated below.\n\n        Health personnel and public service providers where systematically targeted through various\n        channels: e.g., primarily through systematically reaching out to all hospitals in Norway\n        and inviting health personell to participants, through contacting the Associations of all\n        major health-worker groups (i.e., Norwegian Medical Doctors Association; Norwegian Nurses\n        Association, Norwegian Psychologists Association; and other associations related to\n        health-workers) through national TV, national, regional and local radio stations, and\n        national, regional and local newspapers in the different regions of the country, as well as\n        Facebook groups in the different regions of the country. Additionally, a random selection\n        of those qualifying as health-care workers were randomly targeted on Facebook by a Facebook\n        Business algorithm. Public service providers were recruited trough Facebook. Politicians\n        where also systematically contacted, with all political parties being contacted and\n        subsequently sending an e-mail with the survey to their members.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        - None'

S'-  INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n               1. The protocol is open to people of all ages:\n\n                  i. Only patients greater than or equal to 2 years of age can be enrolled at the\n                  Clinical Center\n\n                  ii. Patients who are < 2 years old may be enrolled only remotely and will not be\n                  seen at the Clinical Center.\n\n               2. Must have (or be suspected of having) a viral infection, that is of interest to\n                  LID investigators. Alternatively, must be a close contact of someone who has (or\n                  is suspected of having) a viral infection that is of interest to LID\n                  investigators.\n\n               3. Adults who are unable to provide initial consent may be enrolled providing\n                  procedures per Human Research Protections Program (HRPP) standard operation\n                  procedure (SOP) 14E have been followed.\n\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n          1. Patients who are unable to safely undergo study procedures and tests.\n\n          2. Patients unwilling to have samples collected and stored for future use.\n\n             INCLUSION OF VULNERABLE PARTICIPANTS:\n\n             -Children:\n\n             Children younger than 2 years of age will be enrolled only remotely from non-NIH\n             medical facilities and will not be seen at the Clinical Center, because children of\n             this age are susceptible to viral infections, some of which are more likely to occur\n             in this very young population or could be more severe. Title 45 of the United States\n             Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 46 Subpart D and (OHRSPHRPP SOP 14D) will be\n             followed to comply with research involving children. The proposed research poses a\n             risk no greater than that encountered with blood tests or other minimally invasive\n             tests ordered as part of a routine history and physical examination. The PI will\n             ensure that appropriate permission from each child s parent(s) or guardian has been\n             obtained for participation in this study.\n\n             -Pregnant Women:\n\n             Pregnant women are eligible to participate in this study as they are susceptible to\n             viral infections, some of which may be more severe in this patient population. This\n             study provides an opportunity to learn more about viral infections in pregnant women.\n             This information may be meaningful in informing disease severity, clinical practice\n             for treating pregnant women, or in leading to new treatments for this population. This\n             information cannot be gained without the participation of pregnant women. The primary\n             procedure performed under this protocol is a blood draw but other procedures may be\n             performed and are considered minimal risk in clinical practice. No procedures that\n             would affect a developing fetus or affect a baby through breastfeeding are performed\n             in the protocol.\n\n             -Decisionally Impaired Adults:\n\n             Adults who are unable to provide initial informed consent are eligible to enroll. Also\n             adults who lose the ability to provide on-going consent subsequent to giving initial\n             consent may continue to participate. These adults are susceptible to viral infections\n             and we can learn about viral infections that may occur in this population.\n             Institutionalized adults will not be enrolled. The procedures utilized are clinically\n             considered to be of minimal risk'
