Chronic medical\n             diagnoses/conditions should be stable for the last 60 days (no hospitalizations,\n             emergency room (ER), or urgent care for condition or need for supplemental oxygen).\n             This includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a\n             result of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis/condition in the 60 days\n             before enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of health care\n             provider, insurance company, etc., or done for financial reasons, and in the same\n             class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.\n             Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as\n             determined by the participating site principal investigator (PI) or appropriate\n             sub-investigator, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.\n             Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the\n             participating site PI or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to\n             subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity, and do not indicate\n             a worsening of medical diagnosis/condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent\n             to enrollment and study vaccination are acceptable provided the change was not\n             precipitated by deterioration in the chronic medical condition, and there is no\n             anticipated additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of\n             responses to study vaccination.\n\n         11.

It seems important to include elderly\n             patients who may be under guardianship or curatorship since these patients seem to\n             present the most severe forms. Additionally, the populations most affected by viral\n             myocarditis are generally adolescents and young adults,which justifies including them\n             in the study too. Pregnant women are a population at potentially greater risk,\n             particularly during the third trimester because of the neuro-hormonal changes inherent\n             in pregnancy.

S'Inclusion criteria include:\n\n          1. parents willing to participate in the ASSIST 12-week intervention, who have an\n             offspring with ASD between the ages of 16 and 26 years. This age range was chosen to\n             allow for the testing of whether the ASSIST is more effective if offered prior to\n             versus after high school exit (a key moderator in Aim 4). The investigators set a\n             lower bound of age 16, as that is when transition planning is mandated to have begun\n             in the schools, and an upper bound of age 26 to capture families of youth who are\n             still in the "transition years" as defined by the Institute of Medicine. If both\n             parents in a family want to attend the training, the investigators will allow it but\n             will designate one as the study\'s primary respondent;\n\n          2. parents are willing to be randomized to the treatment or control condition;\n\n          3. parents are able to travel weekly to one of the project sites (Nashville, TN;\n             Chicagoland;IL; Madison/Milwaukee, WI) to participate in the group ASSIST sessions (12\n             weekly sessions). The responding parent and the offspring with ASD must also be able\n             to travel to a project site for a diagnostic evaluation to confirm the ASD diagnosis\n             (using the gold- standard Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 or ADOS-2) and to\n             establish IQ and adaptive behavior functioning;\n\n          4. the participating parent and youth must live in one of the states where the\n             intervention is being delivered, as the adult service system is different in every\n             state;\n\n          5. son/daughter has a previous diagnosis of ASD from an educational or health care\n             provider, and meets lifetime cut-offs for ASD in a telephone screening of the Social\n             Communication Questionnaire. This will decrease the risk that youth fail to meet\n             diagnostic criteria for ASD during the diagnostic evaluation.

S'Inclusion Criteria:\n\n        - Eligible participants are all parents (over 18 years) living with one or more child under\n        18 years, and/or a child over 18 with special needs (i.e. physical disabilities). All\n        participants are currently living in Norway and thus experiencing identical NPIs, and who\n        had provided digital consent to partake in the study.\n\n        How the participants were reached:\n\n        Given the time-sensitivity of the project and the strict and time-consuming process of\n        getting approval to access registry data, the investigators did not apply for access to\n        registry data (e.g., address, phone or e-mails of the general population), as such data\n        access is highly strict and regulated in Norway and the time-frame of such an application\n        could have encompassed variation in an important variable we wished to hold constant\n        (namely identical NPIs (non-pharmacological interventions) employed over the time-frame of\n        data collection). Thus, the investigators did not apply for registry data, reached out the\n        population through the means elaborated below. The investigators reached out to the general\n        Norwegian population systematically in the following six ways, with the goal of providing\n        the entire adult population an equal opportunity to be exposed to the survey:\n\n          1. Through broadcasting on the main national news channel of Norway which had nearly 1.1\n             million viewers at the time of broadcast.\n\n          2. Using Facebook Business Advertisement where we exposed all adult Norwegian Facebook\n             users (3.6 million; 85% of the Norwegian adult population) with an equal opportunity\n             of being exposed to the survey in a random manner. Our survey reached a random\n             selection of nearly 180 000 of the adult population.\n\n          3. Broadcasting the survey on national and region radio stations across the country\n\n          4. Broadcasting about the survey on local radio stations across the country\n\n          5. Using national newspaper to reach out to participants about the survey\n\n          6. Using regional and local newspapers to reach out to participants across all regions\n             and counties in Norway.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        - None'

S'-  INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n               1. The protocol is open to people of all ages:\n\n                  i. Only patients greater than or equal to 2 years of age can be enrolled at the\n                  Clinical Center\n\n                  ii. Patients who are < 2 years old may be enrolled only remotely and will not be\n                  seen at the Clinical Center.\n\n               2. Must have (or be suspected of having) a viral infection, that is of interest to\n                  LID investigators. Alternatively, must be a close contact of someone who has (or\n                  is suspected of having) a viral infection that is of interest to LID\n                  investigators.\n\n               3. Adults who are unable to provide initial consent may be enrolled providing\n                  procedures per Human Research Protections Program (HRPP) standard operation\n                  procedure (SOP) 14E have been followed.\n\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n          1. Patients who are unable to safely undergo study procedures and tests.\n\n          2. Patients unwilling to have samples collected and stored for future use.\n\n             INCLUSION OF VULNERABLE PARTICIPANTS:\n\n             -Children:\n\n             Children younger than 2 years of age will be enrolled only remotely from non-NIH\n             medical facilities and will not be seen at the Clinical Center, because children of\n             this age are susceptible to viral infections, some of which are more likely to occur\n             in this very young population or could be more severe. Title 45 of the United States\n             Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 46 Subpart D and (OHRSPHRPP SOP 14D) will be\n             followed to comply with research involving children. The proposed research poses a\n             risk no greater than that encountered with blood tests or other minimally invasive\n             tests ordered as part of a routine history and physical examination. The PI will\n             ensure that appropriate permission from each child s parent(s) or guardian has been\n             obtained for participation in this study.\n\n             -Pregnant Women:\n\n             Pregnant women are eligible to participate in this study as they are susceptible to\n             viral infections, some of which may be more severe in this patient population. This\n             study provides an opportunity to learn more about viral infections in pregnant women.\n             This information may be meaningful in informing disease severity, clinical practice\n             for treating pregnant women, or in leading to new treatments for this population. This\n             information cannot be gained without the participation of pregnant women. The primary\n             procedure performed under this protocol is a blood draw but other procedures may be\n             performed and are considered minimal risk in clinical practice. No procedures that\n             would affect a developing fetus or affect a baby through breastfeeding are performed\n             in the protocol.\n\n             -Decisionally Impaired Adults:\n\n             Adults who are unable to provide initial informed consent are eligible to enroll. Also\n             adults who lose the ability to provide on-going consent subsequent to giving initial\n             consent may continue to participate. These adults are susceptible to viral infections\n             and we can learn about viral infections that may occur in this population.\n             Institutionalized adults will not be enrolled. The procedures utilized are clinically\n             considered to be of minimal risk'
