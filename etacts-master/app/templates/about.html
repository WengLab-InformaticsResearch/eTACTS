<p> One major limitation of existing clinical trial search engines is the underutilization of free-text eligibility criteria. Nevertheless, they contain details about eligible research volunteers that should be taken into account to provide meaningful and limited-size results to the end users. To this aim we developed eTACTS, a novel interactive retrieval framework using common eligibility tags to dynamically filter clinical trial search results.</p>

<p> eTACTS was developed at the <a href="http://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Biomedical Informatics</a>, <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Columbia University</a>, New York, NY, USA. The principal investigator of the project is <a class='bold' href="http://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~chw7007/" target="_blank">Dr. Chunhua Weng</a>. This work was supported by research grants <span class="grants">R01LM009886</span> and <span class="grants">R01LM010815</span> from the <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/" target="_blank">National Library of Medicine</a>.</p>

<p> eTACTS is optimized to work with recent versions of Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari. No tests were performed with any version of Internet Explorer.</p>

<h3 id="HowToUse">Overview of the System</h3>
  <p> eTACTS includes two components: (a) offline unsupervised tag mining and clinical trial indexing; and (b) online tag-based trial search. The system is linked to the <a href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov" target="_blank">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> repository through the freely available API; data is updated internally on a daily basis over night.</p>

  <p><span class="grants">(a) Unsupervised Tag Mining and Clinical Trial Indexing: </span> state-of-the-art methods to process eligibility criteria parse clinical trials separately without considering any type of similarity among them. However, this leads to an uncontrolled vocabulary of annotations that is difficult to use in information retrieval systems because of its high dimensionality and of the likely presence of too specific or not relevant concepts. In contrast, we propose that cross-processing eligibility criteria from multiple studies to mine an UMLS-controlled vocabulary of tags that are shared by clinical trials can be a valuable alternative for automatic trial indexing and retrieval. In this context, a tag is defined as a meaningful multi-word pattern in the free-text eligibility criteria (e.g., "breast carcinoma", "diabetes", "active malignancy") that frequently appears within a collection of clinical trials. Therefore, in this work, we used an unsupervised, fully automatic data mining approach to discover a controlled vocabulary of tags for eligibility criteria frequently shared across clinical trials, and used these tags for efficient trial indexing and retrieval.</p>

  <p><span class="grants">(b) Tag-based Clinical Trial Retrieval: </span> the compact representation of eligibility criteria based on a controlled vocabulary of tags can favor interactive retrieval of clinical trials because these tags are likely to be more generic and intuitive (given their high frequency nature) than independent annotations. Consequently, we developed eTACTS, a clinical trial search engine, which exploits a cloud of tags to help users filtering the resulting trials of a simple search. After an initial search (free-text query or advanced form-based), a tag cloud is generated with respect to the current results and presented to the user. When the user selects any tag, eTACTS retains only the trials containing all the tags chosen till that moment in their eligibility criteria and suggests a new cloud based on the tag distribution in the remaining trials. The process iterates until a desired number of trials are returned.</p>

<h3 id="HowToUse">Code</h3>
  <p> The code for running locally eTACTS is available for download <a class='bold hightlight' href="https://github.com/riccardomiotto/etacts" target="_blank">here</a>. Note that, while the code is up to date with the online version, the data (i.e., clinical trial descriptions, controlled vocabulary, association rules) is not. If you want to run eTACTS with the updated repository of clinical trials, use the online version. </p>
